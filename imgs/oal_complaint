I booked Ola hyndai Accent to go to EON IT Park Kharadi and had to reach there by 
6:30 PM. Prior to my booking, there was very heavy rain and streets were flooded.
I noticed there was big problem booking cabs to my destination. So asked 2 of my friends
to book cab for the same.
Finally 1 cab got bookeD which cost me around Rs.414
After waiting for 15 mins, I got into the cab and faced major trouble.
The cab driver had installed Uber app as well and within that timespan got another booking
for Airport Road, Pune which was around Rs.850. He had both the customer as well as driver
version of Uber installed.
He argued and wanted me to cancel the trip. It was clear that he wanted to take advantage of the
weather conditions in the city and the distance as well.
I had no other option but to cancel the cab as I was getting late and wait for another one to get booked.

I think the solution to this problem is
1) fixing the fare algorithm and it should not fluctuate frequently between 10-15 mins timespan.
In such worse weather and trafic conditions, the cab drivers are attracted to get better deals of
it.
2) ola drivers should be compelled to use only 1 taxi app only.
3) when the weather or traffic conditions are bad in a particular area, these drivers go offline
for sometime.THey acknowledge demand will shoot up. And even worse these are needy customers in 
such bad conditions.

If such things contine to prevail, then ola will soon become which was once the problem of local rickshaw-taxi drivers. Due to same problem, people shifted to using Ola but infortunately seeing
the same result in different manner.
